# School_Disctrict_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
After analyzing the test proficiency in schools, the school board came to the conclusion that there was evidence of academic dishonesty. The grades from the 9th grade students in Thomas High School were supposed to be altered. In order to uphold state-testing standards, we've been asked to repeat the school district analysis with new math and reading scores for those students. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
